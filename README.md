Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast 
mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. n the 3-
dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear 
Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and 
Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
Given the attached dataset of Breast cancer prediction, apply the following:
